<p>You know those tearjerking videos of cats rescued from dire situations? I have one of those stories, too. </p>

<p>Saved from an almost near-death experience of getting squished by a car, I now live with a loving person — the owner of the car that almost squished me — and have finally found happiness, comfort and warmth!</p>

<p>I’m 8 years old. I walk funny. Because of the accident. However, my roommate Zoey, my feline friend, seems to think my paralyzed paw is pretty cute. When at home, I spend a lot of my time daydreaming about going outside and swatting at dried leaves. Full disclosure: I like to eat those dried leaves. Don’t ask why.</p>

<p>I also like staring out the window, taking lots of naps, eating, catnip and other cats. Dislike being talked to in a baby’s voice and 90s garage music.</p>
